*** This mod has been merged into my bigger mod, 1trickPwnyta's Ideology Patch: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2764625248 If you have that mod, you no longer need this one. ***
	
Did you notice after you installed Ideology that most people don't want to even so much as share a bed before marriage? Are they breaking up with each other before they even make it to marriage because they aren't getting that opinion boost from lovin'? Yes. Unless you're custom-designing the details of each ideology you play.

This mod just makes free physical love the default. You can still pick the spouse only options if you want.
